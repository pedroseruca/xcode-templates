# Installation 

I tried to make as simple as possible, so just follow the next steps and you will be fine:

1. Clone this repo and set the destination path to `~/Library/Developer/Xcode/Templates/`. This is the folder that Xcode will read your custom Templates.
   - If you don't have already a `Templates` folder at `~/Library/Developer/Xcode/`, just make one with command `mkdir Templates`

With this in place, you now have your own repo for your Templates. You can try it out already by creating a new file on Xcode. 
(If you don't see it, try close Xcode and start again, awesome trick right?)


It is most likely that the Templates you find here are not compiling for you ⚠️. This is expected, as it is personalised for my current use case.

Once you have seen it working, I recommend you to start small on: [How to do it](https://github.com/pedroseruca/xcode-templates/blob/main/Documentation/HOWTODOIT.md)
